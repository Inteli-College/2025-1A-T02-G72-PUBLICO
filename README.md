- **Topic:** Digital Marketing for SMEs  
- **Student:** Lucas de Britto Vieira  
- **Supervisor:** Bruna Mayer  

## Summary

Throughout this module, an exploration was carried out regarding the challenges faced by Brazilian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in terms of digital presence and marketing strategies. This led to a proposed solution based on an accessible and intelligent digital marketing tool focused on content automation via WhatsApp.

## Phase 1: Exploratory Analysis and Hypothesis Building

Sprint 2 focused on understanding the context of SMEs in Brazil amidst digital transformation. The main challenges identified were:

- Financial and technical limitations  
- Lack of strategic knowledge in digital marketing  
- Difficulty in measuring results  
- Inconsistent digital presence  

Based on this, general and specific hypotheses were constructed for SMEs, with an emphasis on the food sector. Proto-personas were also developed, such as Jorge (restaurant owner) and Ana (customer), to support future project decisions.

## Phase 2: Qualitative Research

An in-depth interview was conducted with a restaurant owner with over 20 years of experience, located in downtown São Paulo. The research brought key insights:

- Despite acknowledging the importance of digital marketing, managing daily operations prevents deeper involvement with digital tools  
- Consultancies are seen as effective solutions but are considered expensive  
- There is openness to digital solutions, though human presence is still valued  
- The biggest pain points are time constraints, lack of technical knowledge, and difficulty interpreting metrics  

## Phase 3: Benchmark and TAM, SAM, SOM

During this phase, a market benchmark analysis was conducted using tools such as Jasper, HubSpot, Clarice AI, and Grammarly. This revealed an opportunity to create a more accessible and user-friendly solution.

Additionally, a TAM, SAM, and SOM analysis was carried out to estimate the potential market:

- **TAM:** R$ 30 billion/year  
- **SAM:** R$ 10 billion/year  
- **SOM (São Paulo, food sector):** R$ 176 million/year  

This analysis reinforced the potential impact of the proposed solution.

## Phase 4: Value Proposition Canvas and MVP Sketch

Based on the identified pain points and needs, the Value Proposition Canvas was developed, highlighting that the tool should:

- Automatically generate content using AI  
- Schedule posts intelligently  
- Provide simple reports via WhatsApp  

Thus, it must be accessible, intuitive, and adapted to the reality of small business owners.

An initial MVP sketch was also presented, which will operate via WhatsApp, automating marketing actions with just a few clicks. The proposal aims to democratize access to digital marketing in a simple, cost-effective, and efficient way.

## Next Steps

- Detail technical features (such as integration with WhatsApp and Instagram APIs)  
- Prototype the AI conversational interface  
- Conduct tests with real entrepreneurs  
- Refine the MVP based on feedback and validation
