## Summary

This module addressed digital marketing strategies for SMEs, with a focus on social media, content creation, and building a digital presence. In each sprint, tool features were designed, such as onboarding, post generation, scheduling, and results analysis. This allowed the creation of a functional MVP and the testing of the core of the solution: content generation.

## Phase 1: Digital Marketing Exploration

This sprint established the conceptual basis for the project with a focus on digital marketing for SMEs. The content developed included a marketing glossary, an overview of trends for 2025 and strategies for Instagram, as well as guidelines on influencer marketing, social media marketing, social media management, and engagement tactics. During the sprint, strategic opportunities were also mapped, such as the use of micro-influencers, educational carousels, humanized storytelling and continuous monitoring of trends via AI.


## Phase 2: Solution Definition

The solution was designed, structured from the onboarding flow where AI collects detailed business information and, from that, builds a personalized knowledge base. Functionalities such as content generation with two modes (guided and automatic), post scheduling (manual or intelligent), and performance report delivery were also explored. Everything is integrated via WhatsApp, with a focus on personalization, practicality, and simplicity.


## Phase 3: Technical Architecture

The focus was on building the technical architecture of the solution and the local implementation of the MVP with Docker, including N8N, WAHA, and PostgreSQL services. The conversational agent flow via WhatsApp was set up with Google Gemini integration, allowing the user to create personalized posts based on simple questions. Furthermore, the modular structure of the solution was detailed: internal/external knowledge bases, AI-powered content generation, intelligent scheduling, and engagement metric collection.


## Phase 4: Solution Refinement

This sprint enhanced the MVP with the introduction of image generation via DALL·E 2 and automated upload to Supabase, allowing the user to receive texts, hashtags, and images ready for posting. Tests were conducted with real users, whose feedback resulted in adjustments to the usability flow: improvements in image quality, future integration with the WhatsApp Pro API for direct media sending, among others.

## Next Steps

* MVP Enhancement: Implement improvements based on user feedback, especially in terms of user experience and visual quality of the content.
* Addition of New Functionalities: Such as guided generation mode and post scheduling.
* Business Model Definition: Structuring possible monetization methods, validating value propositions, and planning scaling strategies.
