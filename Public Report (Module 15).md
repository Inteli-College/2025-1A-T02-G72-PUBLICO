## Phase 1: New Architecture

In this phase, the new product architecture was defined, focusing on the creation of autonomous and orchestrated AI agents. Specialized modules were structured for strategy, content generation, publishing, and analysis, all integrated by a central orchestrator. This technical foundation consolidated the plan to transform the linear assistant into a complete and automated solution.

## Phase 2: Market Research and Competitor Analysis

The second sprint performed a detailed benchmarking against tools like HubSpot, RD Station, and Jasper, as well as local agencies, identifying gaps and opportunities. The analysis confirmed the potential for a simple, accessible solution focused on SMEs. The SWOT and Porter's matrices were also developed to strategically position the product in the market.

## Phase 3: Monetization and Pricing Plan

The solution's financial model was structured, considering fixed and variable costs and market projection (TAM, SAM, and SOM). Pricing was defined as an accessible monthly subscription, ensuring scalability and sustainability. This phase validated the project's economic viability and laid the groundwork for future growth.

## Phase 4: Business Model Canvas

In this sprint, the Business Model Canvas was elaborated, consolidating customer segments, value proposition, channels, and revenue streams. The initial focus was on SMEs in the food sector, using WhatsApp as the main channel. The model reinforced the goal of simplifying digital marketing through automation and accessible AI for small entrepreneurs.

## Phase 5: Product Development and Validation

The final stage consolidated the functional MVP, integrating generative AI and WhatsApp. A simulated test was conducted with a fictional business, validating the agent's ability to automatically generate complete posts. The result confirmed the practical applicability and the solution's potential to democratize digital marketing for SMEs.
