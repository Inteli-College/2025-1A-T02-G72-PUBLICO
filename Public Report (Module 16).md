## Phase 1: Overall Activity Planning

In this initial phase, the module’s work plan was structured by defining objectives, deliverables, and priorities. The overall planning made it possible to align technical and strategic activities, ensuring an organized evolution of the project. This stage was essential to establish a clear vision of the product, the target market, and the expected outcomes throughout the development process.

## Phase 2: Go-To-Market Strategy

The second phase focused on defining the market entry strategy. Customer acquisition channels, positioning, and competitive differentiators of the solution were analyzed. The strategic planning highlighted the use of WhatsApp as the main interaction channel, along with institutional partnerships and educational strategies to reduce adoption barriers. This stage reinforced the alignment of the value proposition with the behavior and constraints of SMEs.

## Phase 3: Product Refinement

In this phase, the product was refined through the definition and implementation of a multi-agent system for content generation. The architecture evolved to include specialized agents for onboarding, content creation, scheduling, and performance analysis, orchestrated in an integrated manner. This technical refinement consolidated the proposal of transforming simple conversations into structured digital marketing actions.

## Phase 4: Pitch Deck

The fourth phase was dedicated to building the project’s communication materials, including the Pitch Deck and the One Pager. These artifacts synthesize the value proposition, the identified problem, the solution, the business model, and the market potential. The focus was on presenting the project in a clear, objective, and compelling way, both for academic evaluation.

## Phase 5: Final Documentation

In the final stage, the complete project documentation was produced, consolidating all technical, strategic, and market-related decisions made throughout the module. Adjustments and improvements based on received feedback were also incorporated. This phase ensured the overall coherence of the work and resulted in a robust deliverable, ready for final evaluation, highlighting the project’s maturity and its potential for future continuation.
